# Services

Some Mac OS X folder services I use:

- **Init Project**: Open and Run project 

  - open with sublime + npm run development OR
  - open with sublime + sass watch + python serve

- **Open with Sublime Text**: opens folder or file in Sublime Text
- **Open With Terminal**: opens [iTerm](http://iterm2.com/) and navigates to folder
