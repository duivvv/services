# Services

Some Mac OS X folder services I use:

- **Init Project**: runs a couple of commands in series, requires the [init](https://github.com/duivvv/dotfiles/blob/master/.aliases#L93-111) bash function
	- bower install
	- npm install
	- gulp
- **Open with Sublime Text**: opens folder or file in Sublime Text
- **Open With Terminal**: opens [iTerm](http://iterm2.com/) and navigates to folder
